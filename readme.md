A repo for my senior year Fall intensive (10/15/2019) at Make School.


I made a "game" where the player navigates a concrete battlefield and wins by
facing their opponent for an extended period of time.

Game features a Start Screen and two characters to choose from.

Also I made a second level to experiment with projectile logic.

This repo contains my scripts that I use on the game assets in Unity as well as
FBX files of models that I created in Maya that I will use for future development.

NOTE TO SELF:
Look into the best way to use Github with Unity.
